            <p>The <b>GEO</b> <b>K</b>nowledge <b>H</b>ub (GKH) is a central cloud-based digital library providing
              access to Earth Observations applications developed by the GEO Work Programme Activities. The GEO

            <p>The scope of the GKH is to promote the replicability and re-usability of EO Applications by sharing with
              the end users, all the Knowledge Resources essential to fully understand and re-use them. All knowledge
              resources of a registered EO application, will be openly shared, curated and organized into a Knowledge
              Package, including: <b>(A)</b> Research papers and reports describing methods and results; <b>(B)</b>
              Software algorithms and cloud computing resources used for processing; <b>(C)</b> In situ and satellite
              imagery data used and; <b>(D)</b> Results for verification.</p>

            <p>Inside the GKH, the user will find EO applications organized in <b>K</b>nowledge <b>P</b>ackages (KP)

            <p>Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a
              Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication
              is part of an EO application.

              In the GKH, several formats and resource types may be retrieved, including the following:

      <p>The providers, as active members of these communities will have the possibility to manage their knowledge and
        to curate the records before they are published. End-users will be able to find records that are linked to a
