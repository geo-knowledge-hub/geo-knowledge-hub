    description: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United
      Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity
      for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by
      all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize
      that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies
      that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth
      â€“ all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
